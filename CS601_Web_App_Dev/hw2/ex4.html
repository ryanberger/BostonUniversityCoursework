        <h1>4.</h1>
        <h4>The &#60;hr /&#62; tag is incorrectly used within the &#60;p&#62; tag. These are both block elements and therefore cannot be nested. Also, the &#60;p&#62; tags are nested which should not occur and some of them are opened but never closed. All of these examples make the markup invalid</h4>
