	<div>In CSS, the visibility property determines whether or not an element will be shown, but even if the property is set to "hidden", the element will still take up the same amount of space on the page thus still affecting the layout just the same. The display property, on the other hand, when set to "none" will cause the element to disappear from the page AND the layout will behave as though the element is not present.</div>
