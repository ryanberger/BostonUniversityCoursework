	<div>Changing the way a document appears when it gets sent to a printer is simple. All you have to do is declare a CSS at-rule "@media print" which tells the browser which set of CSS rules to use. In this example, the text shown on the screen isn't very easy to read, but if you try to print the page, you'll find that the text becomes much easier to see. Once the browser is finished printing, the presentation will return to its original style declared in "@media screen".</div>
